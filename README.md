# 🧠 My_RL_Experiments

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks where I implement, dissect, and reflect on core RL algorithms—from the classics to the more nuanced.

Whether you're a fellow student, a researcher, or just someone curious, I hope this repository offers clarity, and insight.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

As a master's student in Artificial Intelligence with a background in Civil Engineering. Reinforcement Learning sits at the intersection of control, decision-making, and curiosity—making it the perfect domain to explore both theory and practice.

This repo is my way of:
- **Learning deeply** by building from scratch.
- **Documenting experiments** with clarity and reproducibility.
- **Sharing insights** with others who care about elegant design and practical impact.
- **Show companies** that i can really work and get accepted in the job.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

Each notebook is a standalone exploration of a specific RL algorithm. I’ve tried to keep things modular, well-commented, and visually intuitive.

### Algorithms Implemented:
- 🧠 **DQN** – Deep Q-Network
- 🌀 **PPO** – Proximal Policy Optimization
- 🎭 **A2C** – Advantage Actor-Critic
- 🎯 **REINFORCE** – Monte Carlo Policy Gradient
- 🧬 **DDPG** – Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
- 🕵️‍♂️ **GAIL** – Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
- 🧱 **Grid World** – Tabular and visual exploration of RL basics
